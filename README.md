# Quick Search Box

Very Usefull Plasma widget to search the web instantly.
This has a built in web browser so you can go deep in your search results without ever leaving the widget.

## How to install

I'm hoping to add this widget to KDE store soon so untill then use this method to install

just copy the downloaded folder (**com.github.suhasdissa.quicksearch** folder) to **~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/** folder

## TODO

I'm hoping to add these features in near future :)
- Ability to change default search engine
- Ability to add custom homepage
